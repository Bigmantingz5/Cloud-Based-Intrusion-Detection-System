# Cloud-Based-Intrusion-Detection-System
In the realm of cybersecurity, safeguarding cloud environments against evolving cyber threats poses a significant challenge. Traditional rule-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) often struggle to keep pace with sophisticated attackers, leading to high false positive rates and missed detections. To address this challenge, this project proposes the development of a scalable and adaptive cloud-based IDS leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly the Random Forest algorithm. By analyzing historical data patterns and adapting to novel attack vectors in real-time, the proposed IDS aims to enhance detection accuracy and frequency of cyber-attacks, thus mitigating security risks in cloud-based systems. It proposes to use tools such as Python and Scikit-learn and Google Clouds Compute Engine. Through comprehensive research, prototyping, and evaluation, this project endeavors to contribute to the enhancement of cloud security, ensuring the integrity and resilience of critical data and infrastructure against emerging cyber threats.
